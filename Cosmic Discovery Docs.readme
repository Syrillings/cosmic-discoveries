Best Practices
TypeScript Usage

Strong typing for components
Interface definitions
Type safety
Performance

Optimized images
Lazy loading
Code splitting
Accessibility

Semantic HTML
ARIA labels
Keyboard navigation
Color contrast
Code Organization

Modular components
Clean file structure
Consistent naming conventions
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm or yarn
Installation Steps
Clone the repository
Install dependencies: npm install
Start development server: npm run dev
Important Note
You need to add a build:dev script to your package.json file:


"build:dev": "vite build --mode development"
Development Guidelines
1. Component Creation
Create new components in src/components
Use TypeScript interfaces
Follow existing styling patterns
2. Styling
Use Tailwind CSS classes
Follow cosmic theme
Maintain responsive design
3. Adding New Pages
Create in src/pages directory
Add route in App.tsx
Include in navigation
4. Code Style
Use TypeScript
Follow ESLint rules
Maintain consistent formatting
Future Enhancements
Potential areas for improvement:

User authentication
Interactive 3D models
Real-time space events
Community features
Personal observation logs
Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

Build errors: Check TypeScript types
Style issues: Verify Tailwind classes
Route problems: Check App.tsx configuration
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Cosmic Discoveries project, its structure, features, and development guidelines. It serves as a reference for both users and developers working with the application.
