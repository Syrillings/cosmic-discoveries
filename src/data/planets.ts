The symbol for womanhood has even been adopted as the symbol of this planet of love and strong women, being the first and only one with a feminine name. Prior to being officially dubbed Venus, Greeks and Romans had unknowingly turned Venus into two different stars.

It is a viscous mixture of molten rock about 1.800 mi / 2.900 km thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer – Earth’s crust – goes about 19 mi / 30 km deep on average on land.

The core heats the bottom of the mantle causing convection leading to the warmer material to rise. It takes about 50.000 to 60.000 years for a blob to move a single kilometer. Though the hot material rises towards the surface, it is blocked by the crust. The magmatic rock pushes on the plates, causing them to slide around slowly. Over millions of years, the surface geology of the Earth changed dramatically because of this. Where the crust is weaker magma can push its way through thus erupting onto the surface, forming volcanoes. Because of volcanoes, material wells out creating new land, and they also pump out gas that greatly contributed to Earth’s atmosphere. The interior of the Earth is very hot – comparable to the surface of the Sun. Most of the heat has remained since the Earth’s formation.

When Pluto’s eccentric orbit was understood and its status dropped from that of a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006, Neptune regained the title of the farthest planet in Solar System. Neptune has an average distance of 2.8 billion miles/4.5 billion kilometers or 30.1 AU away from the Sun, and its currently 29.4 AU away from Earth with its light taking up to 4 hours to arrive to us. The mass of Jupiter is about 17 times that of Earth or 1.0243×1026 kg, but when compared to the largest gas giant Jupiter, it has only 1/19th of Jupiter’s mass. It has an equatorial radius of 15.387 miles or 24.764 kilometers, about four times wider than Earth, and a diameter of 49.244 km or 30.598 mi, being the fourth largest planet of the solar system.",

        "The atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane. Very similar to Uranus, its vivid blue color is influenced by the presence of methane and some unknown factor causes the more intense color. Neptune may not be as cold as Uranus but it has the most powerful winds out of all the planets in the Solar System despite being the furthest planet from the Sun and receiving the lowest energy input from it. Having the wildest and strangest weather in the entire Solar System, it is not understood how it gets this much energy in order to produce such weather.",
      secondSection:
        "Neptune has an average temperature of -214 degrees Celsius;-353 degrees. Wind speeds blowing westward on the equator reach up to 2,160 kilometers or 1.324 miles per hour, nearly a supersonic flow. Most winds travel retrograde to the rotation of the planet they are 5 times stronger than the strongest winds recorded on Earth, breaking the sound barrier. Bands and colossal storms also form on the planet.",

    satellite:
      "A total of 14 known moons surround Neptune. They have all been named after water deities in Greek mythology. The first moon discovered was Triton, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered. It is also the largest of the 14 moons. The 14 moons of Neptune can be divided into regular, irregular and unusual irregular moons.",
    facts: [
      " The name Neptune was first given to the seventh discovered planet of the Solar System, Uranus. However, the name was discarded but Uranus ultimately led to the discovery of the eight planet, that would bear the name Neptune.",
      "Uranus is Neptune’s near twin in size and composition.",
      " In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846, meaning we have witnessed just 1 Neptunian year.",
      "Between 2013 - 2049, the closest approach of Neptune to Earth will happen in 2041 at a distance of 28.8 AU.",
      "Because of the dwarf planet Pluto’s elliptical orbit, Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun and Earth than Neptune is.",
      "Neptune is 30 times farther than Earth’s orbit from the sun.",
      "The Sun is 900 times dimmer on Neptune than on Earth.",
      "Most languages use some variant of the name “Neptune” for the planet. In Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean, the planet’s name was translated as “sea king star” while in Mongolian it is called Dalain Van. In modern Greek the name is Poseidon while in Māori the planet is called Tangaroa, the name of the Māori god of the sea.",
      "Neptune has gravity at 1 bar of 11.15 m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth, and surpassed only by Jupiter who has a gravity of 24.79 m/s².",
      " A total of 58 Earths can fit in Neptune.",
      "The Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have reached Neptune to this day.",
      "Neptune has a very strong magnetic field. It is around 27 times stronger than the one on Earth.",
